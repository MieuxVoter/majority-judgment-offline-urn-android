Here are some instrumentation tests.

We simulate touch and general interaction and assert how the UI should behave.
These tests are run on the emulator(s) or connected device.



## Pitfalls

- Use only one `ComposeTestRule` per test file, or brace for errors.

## Caveats

- Not in Gherkin yet _(MRs welcome)_
- Very few tests _(MRs welcome)_
